# cw-record-task

You are given an interface of a simple sample recorder. It has 2 operations:

- to record a sample in a specific campaign
- to return an average of samples, based on a given stragy/mode

Your task is to implement 2 strategies / averaging modes of the sample recorder:

- returning average of last n samples collected by the recorded
- returning average of samples collected in last n seconds

There are a few rules and guidelines regarding the solution:

- Please implement the solution in java.
- You may extend the project with any dependencies needed you need to complete the task in an optimal way.
- Test the code well in terms of cases and best practices.
- You may choose any test framework/language you like apart from the defaults in the project if you like.
- Find the attached project stub in this git repository to begin your work (mvn stub, recorder interface).
- Provide the solution as a pull-request to this repository
